Shortest Paths in a DAG

In this project, the Shortest Path algorithm is applied to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where the edges are assumed to have a uniform weight of 1. 
The goal of the algorithm is to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes based on the number of edges, as opposed to the edge weights in weighted graphs.

Why Use Uniform Edge Weights?

The decision to use uniform edge weights (1 for each edge) is made because the task focuses on counting the number of hops (edges) between nodes, rather than the actual cost or time associated with each edge.
This approach is commonly used in scenarios like unweighted graph traversal or network routing where each step between nodes is treated equally.
